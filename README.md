# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a project done as part of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

## TODO
- [x] Button for random color mode.
- [ ] Allow the user to choose a color.
- [ ] Create different styling for the etch-a-sketch container block. Maybe make it look similar to an actual etch-a-sketch?
- [ ] Allow the user to darken/lighten a color.

## Special Thanks
