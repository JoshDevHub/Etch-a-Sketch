# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a project done as part of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/) curriculum.

Users have access to a sketch pad similar to the popular Etch-a-Sketch toy.

The user can hover their mouse over the canvas to draw on it. They can change the colors or make the colors random. The canvas can be reset, and the user can then choose different pixel sizes to draw on. An eraser button can be used to toggle to eraser mode, where the cursor will change squares that have been filled-in back to the default background.

## Technologies

Built with HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript.

## Improvements

These are low priority because I want to move on in the curriculum and have fulfilled the assigned objectives in the project, but I may return in the future to make all or some of the following improvements: 

- [ ] Make design responsive and have the app work on mobile and touchscreen devices.
- [ ] Improve styles in the control box -- particularly getting away from the default styles on the `<input type="color">` element.
- [ ] Refactor script to use objects and OOP concepts.
